# Simulating Scratchy Analog Film

<br />
<br />

This project consists of 2 simple demos. The filter code is based on Apple's Core Image article posted at the link listed below.

<br />

The aim of the first demo is to apply the chained filter to a photo. The second demo shows how to apply the filter to each frame of a movie.
